#  Heart Failure Survival Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival outcomes of heart failure patients using machine learning techniques. The dataset comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records).

The goal is to build and compare different machine learning models to predict whether a patient will survive or not, based on clinical and demographic features.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Number of patients: 299
- Features: 13 clinical and demographic attributes
- Target: `DEATH_EVENT` (1 = Died, 0 = Survived)

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Current Progress
- Setting up project folder and loading data
- Initial data exploration and cleaning
- Building initial models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, ANN)

## To Do
- Full exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model performance comparison
- Feature importance analysis
- Summary of findings and insights

## How to Run
Clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
