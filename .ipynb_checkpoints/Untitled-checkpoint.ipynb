    "# Heart Failure Survival Prediction Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project focuses on predicting the survival outcomes of heart failure patients using clinical and demographic attributes. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and understanding the factors that influence survival rates is critical for early intervention and improved patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to apply **machine learning techniques** to build and compare predictive models that can forecast whether a heart failure patient will survive or not. In addition to building accurate models, this project aims to identify the key clinical and demographic features that contribute most to survival predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Information\n",
    "The dataset used for this project comes from the **[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records)**. It contains 299 records of patients who experienced heart failure, with 13 clinical and demographic features, along with the target variable `DEATH_EVENT`, which indicates whether the patient survived (0) or died (1).\n",

    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **age** | Patient's age in years. Older patients are typically at higher risk. |\n",
    "| **anaemia** | Whether the patient has low red blood cells (1 = Yes, 0 = No). Anaemia can worsen heart failure outcomes. |\n",
    "| **creatinine_phosphokinase** | Level of CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L). High levels may indicate heart muscle damage. |\n",
    "| **diabetes** | Whether the patient has diabetes (1 = Yes, 0 = No). Diabetes increases heart failure risk. |\n",
    "| **ejection_fraction** | Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction. Low values indicate poor heart function. |\n",
    "| **high_blood_pressure** | Whether the patient has hypertension (1 = Yes, 0 = No). High BP adds stress to the heart. |\n",
    "| **platelets** | Platelet count (kiloplatelets/mL). May indicate blood clotting ability or potential abnormalities. |\n",
    "| **serum_creatinine** | Level of creatinine in the blood (mg/dL). High levels indicate potential kidney problems. |\n",
    "| **serum_sodium** | Level of sodium in the blood (mEq/L). Low levels indicate fluid retention and severe heart failure. |\n",
    "| **sex** | Patient's gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female). Gender can influence survival rates. |\n",
    "| **smoking** | Whether the patient smokes (1 = Yes, 0 = No). Smoking worsens heart and blood vessel health. |\n",
    "| **time** | Follow-up period (days). Shorter times may indicate early death. |\n",
    "| **DEATH_EVENT** | Target variable (1 = Died, 0 = Survived). |\n"
